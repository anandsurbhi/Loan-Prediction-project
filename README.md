# Loan-Prediction-project

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts loan approval outcomes based on applicant data. The goal is to reduce manual processing time and improve the accuracy of loan decisions by automating the approval process.

Business Context:
In the financial sector, loan approval decisions are traditionally made by assessing various applicant attributes, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. By implementing a predictive model, financial institutions can streamline the approval process, reduce default rates, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Data:
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:

Applicant Information: Age, income, employment status, and credit score.
Loan Details: Loan amount, term, and type.
Financial History: Previous loan performance, outstanding debts, and repayment history.
The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature engineering was applied to create relevant features that enhance model performance.

Results:
accuracy_score overall : 0.8094462540716613
accuracy_score percent : 80.94

**** 
This project highlights the potential of machine learning to transform loan approval processes, offering a robust solution to enhance decision-making efficiency in financial services.
